# Joomla-Attendance
Lightweight Attendance Joomla Component

This straighforward attendance component handles events (including location and event type customization), attendees, RSVPs, and reporting. Role and group-based access controls which registered system users are invited to which events and which users are permitted to access reporting and/or approve absences. All reporting is on the front end so that administrative access is not required for users to access attendance reports.

Note that this component currently only supports Joomla 2.x.
